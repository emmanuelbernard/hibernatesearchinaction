<h1>Chapter 6 - Hibernate Search in Action</h1>
<p>This chapter describe how to write an Hibernate Search query.</p>

<h2>Project structure</h2>
<h3>src</h3>
<!--  talk about SessionInvoke thing -->
<p>Contains the example codes. The action package contains the examples using Hibernate Core APIs, action.jpa contains the examples using the Java Persistence API.</p>
<p>Examples are split between BatchChangeAction, ItemAction and DisplayAction.</p>
<h3>test</h3>
<p>Contains the test framework. Several tests are making sure the examples runs. The test framework uses TestNG.</p>
<p>Each test case make use of a data set contained in /import.sql. This data set is a sample of a realistic online catalog.</p>
<p>Each test use a proxy based session/entitymanager initialization and transaction opening/closing. Each test runs inside a transaction just like it would in a container. SessionHolder and EntityManagerHolder keep the FullTextSession and FullTextEntityManager in a thread local for consumption by the services.</p>
<h3>Dependencies</h3>
<p>You can find the libraries necessary to compile and run the tests in ../common/lib</p>
