<h1>Chapter 13 - Hibernate Search in Action</h1>
<p>This chapter describes some of the many contributions to Lucene made by developers and some of the libraries that convert differently formatted documents to Lucene indexes.</p>

<p>The dvd_index directory is the working directory for the majority of examples that do not use a RAMDirectory. This means tests which build their own index will build it in this directory. Since they clean up after themselves, files will be deleted from this directory.</p>
<p>dvd_index_backup holds copies of the dvd_index for copying to the dvd_index directory when running test concerning it. This is taken care of by the tests themselves.</p>
<p>Quite a few of the tests run in a RAM directory so they will not be available to Luke should you want to examine them. This is easily remedied by placing a configuration method in the appropriate test and specifying the FSDirectoryProvider. Also if there is already a configuration present just change the directory type.</p>
<p>The win_s.pl file located in base directory is the synonym building file from WordNet.com. You will need this file if you wish to build the synonym index from scratch.</p>
