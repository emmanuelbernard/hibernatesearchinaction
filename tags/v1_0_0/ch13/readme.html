<h1>Chapter 13 - Hibernate Search in Action</h1>
<p>This chapter describes some of the many contributions to Lucene made by developers and some of the libraries that convert differently formatted documents to Lucene indexes.</p>

<p>The dvd_index directory is the working directory for the majority of examples that do not use a RAMDirectory. This means tests which build their own index will build it in this directory. Since they clean up after themselves, files will be deleted from this directory.</p>
<p>dvd_index_backup holds copies of the dvd_index for copying to the dvd_index directory when running test concerning it. This is taken care of by the tests themselves.</p>
<p>Quite a few of the tests run in a RAM directory so they will not be available to Luke should you want to examine them. This is easily remedied by placing a configuration method in the appropriate test and specifying the FSDirectoryProvider. Also if there is already a configuration present just change the directory type.</p>
<p>In order to run <code>TestSynonyms</code>, you must download <code>WNprolog-3.0.tar.gz</code> (the prolog version of WordNet) that you can find at <a href="http://wordnet.princeton.edu/">http://wordnet.princeton.edu/</a>. In the tar, find the file named <code>wn_s.pl</code> and copy it over to the root directory of these examples (one directory up this file). The <code>wn_s.pl</code> file is the synonym building file from WordNet. You will also need this file if you wish to build the synonym index from scratch.
The synonym index will be automatically built by <code>TestSynonyms</code> and placed in the <code>synonym_index</code> directory.</p>
