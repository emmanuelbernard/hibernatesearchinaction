From The Terminator to Titanic, you can always rely on writer-director James Cameron 
to show you something you've never seen on the big screen before. The guy may not 
consistently pen the most scintillating dialogue in the world (and, especially in this 
movie, he doesn't seem to have a particularly high regard for women), but as a director 
of kinetic, push-the-envelope action sequences, he is in a class by himself. In True Lies, 
the highlight is a breathtaking third-act jet and car chase through the Florida Keys. 
Arnold Schwarzenegger plays a covert intelligence agent whose wife of 15 years (Jamie Lee 
Curtis) finally finds out that he's not really a computer salesman and who becomes mixed 
up in a case involving nuclear arms smuggling. Tom Arnold is surprisingly funny and engaging 
as Schwarzenegger's longtime spy partner, and Bill Paxton is a smarmy used-car salesman (is 
that redundant?) whom Arnold thinks is having an affair with his wife. Purely in terms of 
spectacular action and high-tech hardware, True Lies is a blast.
