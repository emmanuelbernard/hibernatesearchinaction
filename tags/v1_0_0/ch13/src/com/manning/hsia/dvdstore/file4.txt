Two for the Money has a formidable cast: Al Pacino, Matthew McConaughey, and Rene Russo
 (Get Shorty) play compulsive personalities caught up in the high-testosterone world of 
 sports betting. Brandon Lang (McConaughey, Sahara), a once-promising football player 
 sidelined by an injury, has an uncanny knack for totting up the statistics and personalities 
 involved in any football game and picking the winner. But he doesn't gamble himself: He 
 offers tips via a phone line. His string of successful picks attracts the attention of Walter 
 Abrams (Pacino, The Godfather, Dog Day Afternoon), a man building a media empire on sports 
 tips, even though he himself can only resist his own gambling addiction thanks to the fierce 
 devotion of his wife, Toni (Russo, Tin Cup, Get Shorty). Brandon swiftly becomes Walter's 
 protege and transforms into an aggressive, high-risk salesman, even going so far as to change 
 his name to create a new self. But when Brandon starts to think of his knack as magic,
 everything Walter has built around his golden boy starts to teeter. Two for the Money
