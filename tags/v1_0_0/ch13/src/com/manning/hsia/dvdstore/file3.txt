For all of its late-1940s cold war paranoia, pulp fiction dialogue, and frenzied greed, 
Joel and Ethan Coen's The Man Who Wasn't There is their most cool and collected film 
since Blood Simple. An unassuming barber with a scheming wife (Frances McDormand) and a 
serious smoking habit, Ed Crane (Billy Bob Thornton) is an onlooker to his own life, a 
ghostly presence set against a silver-toned film noir backdrop. Only when he decides to 
alter his fate by blackmailing his wife's lover (James Gandolfini) in order to invest 
with a traveling salesman (Jon Polito) touting the wave of the future
