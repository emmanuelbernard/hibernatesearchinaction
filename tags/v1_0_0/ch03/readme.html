<h1>Chapter 3 - Hibernate Search in Action</h1>
<p>This chapter covers basic mapping annotations.</p>

<h2>Project structure</h2>
<h3>src</h3>
<p>Contains the example codes. The package model contains the domain model and demonstrate the use of mapping annotations. Also contains the configuration files.</p>
<p>This project represents the same code base as described in the book but does not cover all cases described in Chapter 3. It gives
a good sample of annotation usage. example.hibernate.cfg.xml does describe a configuration where Lucene indexes are stored on the file system (see Example 3.7).
</p>
<h3>test</h3>
<p>Contains the test framework. Several tests are making sure the examples runs. The test framework uses TestNG.
<h3>Dependencies</h3>
<p>You can find the libraries necessary to compile and run the tests in ../common/lib</p>
